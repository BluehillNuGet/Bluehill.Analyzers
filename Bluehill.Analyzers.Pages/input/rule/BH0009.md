# BH0009: Integers and Decimal should never be divided by the constant 0

Integers and Decimal should never be divided by the constant 0. This may cause a DividedByZeroException. NOTE: This rule supplements CS0020.

## Code with violation

```csharp
public class TestClass {
    public int TestMethod1(int value) {
        return value / 0;
    }

    public int TestMethod2(decimal value) {
        return value / 0m;
    }
}
```
