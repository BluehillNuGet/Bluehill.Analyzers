# BH0017: Prefer Target-Typed new

This is a way to reduce the code length even a little.

## Code with violation

```csharp
public class TestClass {
    public void TestMethod() {
        var o = new object();
    }
}
```

## Fixed Code

```csharp
public class TestClass {
    public void TestMethod() {
        object o = new();
    }
}
```
