# BH0001: Classes without derived types should be sealed

Classes without derived types should be sealed. Note: Sealed or abstract classes, and static classes are not included in this rule.

## Code with violation

```csharp
public class TestClass {
    public void TestMethod() {
        Console.WriteLine("Test");
    }
}

public class AnotherClass;

public class InheritedClass : AnotherClass;
```

## Fixed Code

```csharp
public sealed class TestClass {
    public void TestMethod() {
        Console.WriteLine("Test");
    }
}

public class AnotherClass;

public sealed class InheritedClass : AnotherClass;
```
